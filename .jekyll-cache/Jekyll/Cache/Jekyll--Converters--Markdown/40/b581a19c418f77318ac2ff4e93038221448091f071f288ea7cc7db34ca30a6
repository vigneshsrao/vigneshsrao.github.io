I"ë<p>Hello !</p>

<p>I am a Cyber Security and CTF enthusiast. I especially love anything to do with
systems and application security and live to feel the thrill of a successful
exploit popping a calculator ! I am currently working as a vulnerability researcher
with <a href="https://www.exodusintel.com/">Exodus Intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>In 2020 I graduated from <a href="https://www.amrita.edu/">Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham</a> with a Bachelors degree in
Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

<p>I have been playing CTFs with <a href="https://bi0s.in/">teambi0s</a> since 2017 and have been a CTF junkie for
the duration of my bachelors studies. Check out our <a href="https://blog.bi0s.in/">team blog</a> for more CTF writeups.</p>

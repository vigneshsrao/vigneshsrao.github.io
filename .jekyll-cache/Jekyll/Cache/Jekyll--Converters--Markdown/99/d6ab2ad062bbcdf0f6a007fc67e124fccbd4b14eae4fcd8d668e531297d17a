Usage: python findfile.py &lt;path/to/pcap&gt;<br />

<p>This script can detect files embedded in network capture files and also dump those files out. Wireshark has this file detection and dumping facility inbuilt, but it works only with a limited set of protocols. For example, it does not work if the protocol of the capture file is USB protocol.</p>

<p>This is pretty useful in CTF events, when the number of packets are large and we are required to find a particular file within the capture. Since the detection check is pretty weak, many false alarms are triggred, and corrupted files are dumped.</p>

Hello !

I am a Cyber Security and CTF enthusiast. I especially love anything to do with
systems and application security and live to feel the thrill of a successful
exploit popping a calculator ! I am currently working as a vulnerability researcher
with [Exodus Intelligence](https://www.exodusintel.com/).

In 2020 I graduated from [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/) with a Bachelors degree in
Computer Science and Engineering.

I have been playing CTFs with [teambi0s](https://bi0s.in/) since 2017 and have been a CTF junkie for
the duration of my bachelors studies. Check out our [team blog](https://blog.bi0s.in/) for more CTF writeups.

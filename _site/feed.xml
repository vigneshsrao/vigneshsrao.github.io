      About a couple of weeks ago, teambi0s conducted InCTF, an International level CTF and I had the opportunity to create a couple of challenges - ateles and navarint. ateles . Now let’s delve into ateles!

      I was always very curious about vulnerabilities that kept popping up in the JIT compilers of various popular browsers. A couple of months I came across CVE-2019-11707, which was a type-confusion bug in array_pop, found by saelo from Google’s Project Zero Team and coinbase security and a few days ago decided to try and write an exploit for the same. This post focuses mainly on the exploitation p...

      I wanted to take a few notes about my SpiderMonkey debugging and code review setup so that this can be a reference for the future me :). This short post will be about that only.

Code Review

My favorite editor is Atom and I use the ccls language-server to go through the source code. Some atom packages I use -

  atom-ide-ccls: language-client for ccls

      After getting a bit of hang over the standard C pwnables in CTFs, I was eager to see how this would work in the real world. So I tried starting of with browser pwn. I actually looked at CTFs challenges and though they are not exactly real world I guess they are the closest to it other than actually digging at old CVEs.

Anyway, for the past few days I was trying blazefox from blazeCTF 2018. In ...

      Attachments: binary     libc     exploit

This was a really fun challenge created by angelboy for HITCON CTF 2018. The following will be a writeup for the intended solution as gathered from the exploit script that angelboy uploaded.

Note: During the CTF we solved this challenge in a really impractical way (brute-forcing 12 bit’s of libc address to get to __free_hook and one_gadget). The intend...

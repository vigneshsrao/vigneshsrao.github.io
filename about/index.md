<center><b>JBlog</b> is a simple jekyll theme.</center> -->

I am a cyber security enthusiast studying Computer Engineering at Amrita University, Amritapuri. I am also a member of Team bi0s, the CTF team of Amrita Universityâ€™s Amritapuri Campus and am particularly interested in the fields of Binary Exploitation and Cyber Forensics. 

By the way, I have posted most of my write-ups on the [bi0s blog](https://amritabi0s.wordpress.com/). They can be found [here](https://amritabi0s.wordpress.com/author/vignesh362/)
